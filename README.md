# tiny-ray-caster
# A tiny ray casting engine for 3D games, similar to Wolfenstein 3D by id Software.

I originally wrote a version of this ray casting engine in Borland Turbo C++ for DOS, back in the mid 90s.  I managed to squeeze the entire engine into just one page of C code!  In 2015, I managed to recreate the project in Processing (Java), allowing for cross-platform compilation and execution.

This engine would provide a good foundation for a simple 3D game, similar to Wolfenstein 3D.  Or, it could be a fun platform for developing artificial intelligence for maze navigation.  Or driverless vehicles...  The possibilities certainly aren't endless, but there's a lot of fun to be had with this engine!  I hope you enjoy it.
